# Virtual Item Store API

Api is live at https://virtual-item-store.herokuapp.com/api/v1 for tests, deployed on Heroku and AWS for RDS

To use the application you must create a user using the /user/register endpoint, and then /user/login to receive a token which you will attach to you request header from now on with the key token.
